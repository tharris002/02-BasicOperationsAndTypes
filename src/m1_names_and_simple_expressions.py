# DONE: 1. (1 pt)
#   Read the 2 lines of code ABOVE this _TODO_.  That code:
#     1. Computes 2 plus 5, yielding the object that is
#          the integer 7.
#     2. Makes the name   answer   refer to that object.
#     3. Looks up the object to which the name   answer  refers (i.e., 7).
#     4. Multiplies that object (7) by 1000 (hence computing the object
#          that is the integer 7,000).
#     5. Prints the newly-computed object.  (It prints WITHOUT the comma.)
#
#   Make sure that you understand that those two lines do the above,
#     ** ASKING QUESTIONS AS NEEDED. **
#
#   For your reference:
#       + is the operator for addition
#       - is the operator for subtraction
#       * is the operator for multiplication
#       / is the operator for division
#
#   Once you completely understand the code above this _TODO_, run this module,
#   confirming that it prints 7000.  Then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# DONE: 2. (1 pt)
#   Immediately below this _TODO_, write code that:
#     - Computes 77 minus the division between 13 and 2.
#         - Do this in three ways:
#           1. Without any parentheses
#           2. With parentheses around 13 divided by 2
#           3. With parentheses around 77 minus 13
#     - Store those computed values using different names of your own choosing
#       to help you know which is which.
#     - Prints each of the computed values.
#
#   Run your code (fix errors as needed) and make sure you understand why it
#   is getting each value (you may want to open a calculater on your computer
#   to check the results). 
#       HINT: remember your order of operations
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

#   Immediately below this _TODO_, write code that:

#   Immediately below this _TODO_, write code that:
#     - Computes 7 divided by 2 and stores the result to the name  result  .
#     - Computes just the quotient of 7 divided by 2 (HINT: use  //  as the 
#       operator) and stores the result to the name  quotient  .
#     - Computes the remainder of 7 divided by 2 (HINT: use  %  as the 
#       operator) and stores the result to the name  remainder  .
#     - Prints each of the computed values
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO to DONE.
